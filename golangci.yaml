    - gosimple # specializes in simplifying a code
    - govet # reports suspicious constructs, such as Printf calls whose arguments do not align with the format string
    - ineffassign # detects when assignments to existing variables are not used
    - staticcheck # is a go vet on steroids, applying a ton of static analysis checks
    - typecheck # like the front-end of a Go compiler, parses and type-checks Go code
    - unused # checks for unused constants, variables, functions and types
